To run the tests - you should have marvin installed and correctly importable.
The tests are long running and are best monitored by external hudson jobs.

Also you will have to point marvin to the right configuration file that has
details about your cloudstack deployment. For more help on how to write the
config file and run tests check the tutorial at :
