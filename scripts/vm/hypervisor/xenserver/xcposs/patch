# This file specifies the files that need
# to be transferred over to the XenServer.
# The format of this file is as follows:
# [Name of file]=[source path],[file permission],[destination path]
# [destination path] is required.
# If [file permission] is missing, 755 is assumed.
# If [source path] is missing, it looks in the same
# directory as the patch file.
# If [source path] starts with '/', then it is absolute path.
# If [source path] starts with '~', then it is path relative to management server home directory.
# If [source path] does not start with '/' or '~', then it is relative path to the location of the patch file. 
# 
# The following specifies the paths to deposit files
# /usr/lib/xcp/plugins - All XAPI plugins.  Every file placed here should start with "cloud-".
# /etc/cloud - Configuration files for scripts.
# /usr/lib/cloud/bin - All scripts used in the normal operation.
# /usr/lib/cloud/tools/bin - All scripts used for testing/support that are meant to be run by hand.
# /etc/logrotate.d - All cloud log rotation configuration files.  Every file placed here must start with "cloud-".
