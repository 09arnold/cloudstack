    <title>Building RPMs</title>
    <para>As mentioned previously in <xref linkend="sect-source-prereq" />, you'll need
       to install several prerequisites before you can build packages for CloudStack. 
       Here we'll assume you're working with a 64-bit build of CentOS or Red Hat 
       Enterprise Linux. </para>
   <para><programlisting># yum groupinstall "Development Tools"</programlisting></para>
   <para><programlisting># yum install java-1.6.0-openjdk-devel.x86_64 ant ant-jdepend genisoimage mysql mysql-server ws-common-utils MySQL-python tomcat6</programlisting></para>
   <para>Next, you'll need to install build-time dependencies for CloudStack with 
       Maven. We're using Maven 3, so you'll want to 
       <ulink url="http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi">grab a Maven 3 tarball</ulink> 
       and uncompress it in your home directory (or whatever location you prefer):</para>
   <para><programlisting>$ tar zxvf apache-maven-3.0.4-bin.tar.gz</programlisting></para>
   <para><programlisting>$ export PATH=/usr/local/apache-maven-3.0.4//bin:$PATH</programlisting></para>
   <para>Maven also needs to know where Java is, and expects the JAVA_HOME environment 
       variable to be set:</para>
   <para><programlisting>$ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.6.0-openjdk.x86_64/</programlisting></para>
   <para>Verify that Maven is installed correctly:</para>
   <para><programlisting>$ mvn --version</programlisting></para>
   <para>You probably want to ensure that your environment variables will survive a logout/reboot. 
       Be sure to update <filename>~/.bashrc</filename> with the PATH and JAVA_HOME variables.</para>
   <para>Now it's time to grab the dependencies to build CloudStack:</para>
   <para><programlisting><prompt>$</prompt> <command>mvn</command> -P deps</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
       Now that we have resolved the dependencies we can move on to building &PRODUCT;
       and packaging them into RPMs by issuing the following command. 
       <programlisting><prompt>$</prompt> <command>./waf</command> rpm</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
       Once this completes, you should find assembled RPMs in
       <filename>artifacts/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64</filename>
    </para>
    <section id="sect-source-buildrpm-repo">
       <title>Creating a yum repo</title>
       <para>
          While RPMs is an ideal packaging format - it's most easily consumed from 
          yum repositories over a network. We'll move into the directory with the
          newly created RPMs by issuing the following command: 
          <programlisting><prompt>$</prompt> <command>cd</command> artifacts/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64</programlisting>
       </para>
       <para>
          Next we'll issue a command to create the repository metadata by
          issuing the following command: 
          <programlisting><prompt>$</prompt> <command>createrepo</command> ./</programlisting>
       </para>
       <para>
          The files and directories within our current working directory can now
          be uploaded to a web server and serve as a yum repository
       </para>
    </section>
    <section id="sect-source-buildrpm-repo2">
       <title>Configuring your systems to use your new yum repository</title>
       <para>
          Now that your yum repository is populated with RPMs and metadata
          we need to configure our machines that need to install CloudStack.
          We will create a file at <filename>/etc/yum.repos.d/cloudstack.repo</filename>
          with the following content: 
<programlisting>
[apache-cloudstack]
name=Apache CloudStack
baseurl=http://<replaceable>webserver.tld/path/to/repo</replaceable>
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
         Completing this step will allow you to easily install CloudStack on a number of 
         machines across the network. 
      </para>
