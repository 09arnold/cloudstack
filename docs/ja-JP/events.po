"An event is essentially a significant or meaningful change in the state of "
"both virtual and physical resources associated with a cloud environment. "
"Events are used by monitoring systems, usage and billing systems, or any "
"other event-driven workflow systems to discern a pattern and make the right "
"business decision. In &PRODUCT; an event could be a state change of virtual "
"or psychical resources, an action performed by an user (action events), or "
"policy based events (alerts)."
