		Part of adding a zone is setting up the physical network. One or (in an advanced zone) more physical networks can be associated with each zone. The network corresponds to a NIC on the hypervisor host. Each physical network can carry one or more types of network traffic. The choices of traffic type for each network vary depending on whether you are creating a zone with basic networking or advanced networking.

	</div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
				Guest. When end users run VMs, they generate guest traffic. The guest VMs communicate with each other over a network that can be referred to as the guest network.

			</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">

				</div></div></div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
				Public. Public traffic is generated when VMs in the cloud access the Internet. Publicly accessible IPs must be allocated for this purpose. End users can use the CloudStack UI to acquire these IPs to implement NAT between their guest network and the public network, as described in Acquiring a New IP Address.
			</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
				Storage. Traffic such as VM templates and snapshots, which is sent between the secondary storage VM and secondary storage servers.

			</div></li></ul></div><div class="para">
		In a basic network, configuring the physical network is fairly straightforward. In most cases, you only need to configure one guest network to carry traffic that is generated by guest VMs. If you use a NetScaler load balancer and enable its elastic IP and elastic load balancing (EIP and ELB) features, you must also configure a network to carry public traffic. CloudStack takes care of presenting the necessary network configuration steps to you in the UI when you add a new zone.

				Guest. When end users run VMs, they generate guest traffic. The guest VMs communicate with each other over a network that can be referred to as the guest network. This network can be isolated or shared. In an isolated guest network, the administrator needs to reserve VLAN ranges to provide isolation for each CloudStack account’s network (potentially a large number of VLANs). In a shared guest network, all guest VMs share a single network.

		In each zone, you need to configure a range of reserved IP addresses for the management network. This network carries communication between the CloudStack Management Server and various system VMs, such as Secondary Storage VMs, Console Proxy VMs, and DHCP.
	</div><div class="para">
		The reserved IP addresses must be unique across the cloud. You cannot, for example, have a host in one zone which has the same private IP address as a host in another zone.
	</div><div class="para">
		The hosts in a pod are assigned private IP addresses. These are typically RFC1918 addresses. The Console Proxy and Secondary Storage system VMs are also allocated private IP addresses in the CIDR of the pod that they are created in.
	</div><div class="para">
		Make sure computing servers and Management Servers use IP addresses outside of the System Reserved IP range. For example, suppose the System Reserved IP range starts at 192.168.154.2 and ends at 192.168.154.7. CloudStack can use .2 to .7 for System VMs. This leaves the rest of the pod CIDR, from .8 to .254, for the Management Server and hypervisor hosts.

	</div><div class="para">
		For zones with advanced networking, we recommend provisioning enough private IPs for your total number of customers, plus enough for the required CloudStack System VMs. Typically, about 10 additional IPs are required for the System VMs. For more information about System VMs, see Working with System Virtual Machines in the Administrator's Guide.
	</div><div class="para">
		When advanced networking is being used, the number of private IP addresses available in each pod varies depending on which hypervisor is running on the nodes in that pod. Citrix XenServer and KVM use link-local addresses, which in theory provide more than 65,000 private IP addresses within the address block. As the pod grows over time, this should be more than enough for any reasonable number of hosts as well as IP addresses for guest virtual routers. VMWare ESXi, by contrast uses any administrator-specified subnetting scheme, and the typical administrator provides only 255 IPs per pod. Since these are shared by physical machines, the guest virtual router, and other entities, it is possible to run out of private IPs when scaling up a pod whose nodes are running ESXi.
	</div><div class="para">
		To ensure adequate headroom to scale private IP space in an ESXi pod that uses advanced networking, use one or both of the following techniques:
	</div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
				Specify a larger CIDR block for the subnet. A subnet mask with a /20 suffix will provide more than 4,000 IP addresses.
			</div></li><li class="listitem"><div class="para">
				Create multiple pods, each with its own subnet. For example, if you create 10 pods and each pod has 255 IPs, this will provide 2,550 IP addresses.
