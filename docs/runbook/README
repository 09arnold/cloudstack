Welcome. 

This file will talk about hacking on the Runbook document. 

The document itself is written using DocBook XML with a publishing tool
called Publican. You can find more about publican at:
http://fedorahosted.org/publican

In addition to needing publican - you will also need the CloudStack brand
for publican. This package contains all of the standard legal disclaimers,
logos, etc, to 'brand' the document as part of Apache CloudStack project. 

In CloudStack's source repo that is located at docs/publican-cloudstack.

Patches are encouraged and welcome; as are forks! If you want to take this Runbook
as a base and extend it to a different hypervisor, or a different networking model
or something else entirely, please do so.
