    <title>Building DEB packages</title>
    <para>
       In addition to the bootstrap dependencies, you'll also need to install
       a few other dependencies by issuing the following commands: 
       <programlisting><prompt>#</prompt> <command>apt-get</command> update</programlisting>
       <programlisting><prompt>$</prompt> <command>apt-get</command> install debhelper openjdk-6-jdk tomcat6 libws-commons-util-java genisoimage python-mysqldb</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
       While we have defined, and you have presumably already installed the
       bootstrap prerequisites, there are a number of build time prerequisites
       that need to be resolved. &PRODUCT; uses maven for dependency resolution.
       You can resolve the buildtime depdencies for CloudStack by running the
       following command:
       <programlisting><prompt>$</prompt> <command>mvn</command> -P deps</programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
       Now that we have resolved the dependencies we can move on to building &PRODUCT;
       and packaging them into DEBs by issuing the following command.
       <programlisting><prompt>#</prompt> <command>dpkg-buildpackage</command></programlisting>
    </para>

          Now that we have created the repository, you need to configure your machine 
          to make use of the APT repository. We do that by issuing the following commands:
          <programlisting><prompt>$</prompt> <command>echo</command> "deb <replaceable>http://url.to/apt/repo</replaceable> $(lsb_release -s -c) 4.0" > <filename>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudstack.list</filename></programlisting>
