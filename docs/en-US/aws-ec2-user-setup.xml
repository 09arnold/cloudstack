     To use the EC2 command line tools, setup the environment variable in a similar fashion than with Amazon EC2 service. Specifically, in bash shell:
     <programlisting>
       $ export EC2_CERT=/path/to/cert.pem
       $ export EC2_PRIVATE_KEY=/path/to/private_key.pem
       $ export EC2_URL=http://<replaceable>&PRODUCT;.server</replaceable>:8080/awsapi
       $ export EC2_HOME=/path/to/EC2_tools_directory
     </programlisting>
   </para>

   <note>
     <para>The Amazon EC2 command-line tools have a default connection timeout. If you find that EC2 commands are not completing due to timeouts, you can pass a new timeout value as an argument with <programlisting>--connection-timeout TIMEOUT </programlisting> or <programlisting>--request-timeout TIMEOUT </programlisting>
