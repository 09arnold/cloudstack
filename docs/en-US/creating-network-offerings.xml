            provider for any of the services selected is Virtual Router. Choose the system service
            offering that you want the virtual routers to use in this network. For example, if you
            selected Load Balancer in Supported Services and select a Virtual Router to provide load
            balancing, the System Offering field appears so you can choose between the &PRODUCT;
            default system service offering and any custom system service offerings that have been
            defined by the &PRODUCT; root administrator. For more information, see System Service

            isolation you want for the network: Shared or Dedicated.</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Dedicated</emphasis>: If you select dedicated LB isolation, a
            dedicated load balancer device is assigned for the network from the pool of dedicated
            load balancer devices provisioned in the zone. If no sufficient dedicated load balancer
            devices are available in the zone, network creation fails. Dedicated device is a good
            choice for the high-traffic networks that make full use of the device's
            resources.</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Shared</emphasis>: If you select shared LB isolation, a shared
            load balancer device is assigned for the network from the pool of shared load balancer
            devices provisioned in the zone. While provisioning &PRODUCT; picks the shared load
            balancer device that is used by the least number of accounts. Once the device reaches
            its maximum capacity, the device will not be allocated to a new account.</para>

            Side mode:</para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Inline mode</emphasis>: Supported only for Juniper SRX
            firewall and BigF5 load balancer devices. In inline mode, a firewall device is placed in
            front of a load balancing device. The firewall acts as the gateway for all the incoming
            traffic, then redirect the load balancing traffic to the load balancer behind it. The
            load balancer in this case will not have the direct access to the public network. </para>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Side by Side</emphasis>: In side by side mode, a firewall
            device is deployed in parallel with the load balancer device. So the traffic to the load
            balancer public IP is not routed through the firewall, and therefore, is exposed to the
            public network.</para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold">Redundant router capability</emphasis>: (v3.0.3 and greater)
            Available only when Virtual Router is selected as the Source NAT provider. Select this
            option if you want to use two virtual routers in the network for uninterrupted
            connection: one operating as the master virtual router and the other as the backup. The
            master virtual router receives requests from and sends responses to the user’s VM. The
            backup virtual router is activated only when the master is down. After the failover, the
            backup becomes the master virtual router. &PRODUCT; deploys the routers on different
            hosts to ensure reliability if one host is down.</para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold">Conserve mode</emphasis>: Specify whether to use conserve
            mode. In this mode, network resources are allocated only when the first virtual machine
            starts in the network. When the conservative mode is off, the public IP can only be used
            for a single service. For example, a public IP used for a port forwarding rule cannot be
            used for defining other services, such as SaticNAT or load balancing. When the conserve
            mode is on, you can define more than one service on the same public IP.</para>
          <note>
            <para>If StaticNAT is enabled, irrespective of the status of the conserve mode, no port
              forwarding or load balancing rule can be created for the IP. However, you can add the
              firewall rules by using the createFirewallRule command.</para>
