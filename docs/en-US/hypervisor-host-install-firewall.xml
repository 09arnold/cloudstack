    <title>Configuring the firewall</title>
    <para>The hypervisor needs to be able to communicate with other hypervisors and the management server needs to be able to reach the hypervisor.</para>
    <para>In order to do so we have to open the following TCP ports (if you are using a firewall):</para>
    <orderedlist>
        <listitem><para>22 (SSH)</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>1798</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>16509 (libvirt)</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>5900 - 6100 (VNC consoles)</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>49152 - 49216 (libvirt live migration)</para></listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>It depends on the firewall you are using how to open these ports. Below you'll find examples how to open these ports in RHEL/CentOS and Ubuntu.</para>

        <title>Open ports in Ubuntu</title>
        <para>The default firewall under Ubuntu is UFW (Uncomplicated FireWall), although not enabled.</para>
        <para>To open the required ports, execute the following commands:</para>
        <programlisting language="Bash">ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 22</programlisting>
        <programlisting language="Bash">ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 1798</programlisting>
        <programlisting language="Bash">ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 16509</programlisting>
        <programlisting language="Bash">ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 5900:6100</programlisting>
        <programlisting language="Bash">ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 49152:492160</programlisting>
        <note><para>By default UFW is not enabled on Ubuntu. Executing these commands with the firewall disabled does not enable the firewall.</para></note>
