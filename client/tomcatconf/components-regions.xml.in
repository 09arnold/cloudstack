  components.xml is the configuration file for the VM Ops
  insertion servers.  Someone can quickly pull together an
  insertion server by selecting the correct adapters to use.

  Here are some places to look for information.
    - To find out the general functionality that each Manager 
      or Adapter provide, look at the javadoc for the interface
      that it implements.  The interface is usually the
      "key" attribute in the declaration.
    - To find specific implementation of each Manager or
      Adapter, look at the javadoc for the actual class.  The 
      class can be found in the <class> element.
    - To find out the configuration parameters for each Manager 
      or Adapter, look at the javadoc for the actual implementation
      class.  It should be documented in the description of the 
      class.
    - To know more about the components.xml in general, look for
      the javadoc for ComponentLocator.java.

  If you found that the Manager or Adapter are not properly 
  documented, please contact the author.
